# Service Catalog:  Business Logic

This Service Catalogue is responsible to document all the RestAPI services which are related to the Business Logic layer.  

The document is structured in the logic of the main objects that exist under the concept of Mqtt Sensors. 

Each service is described under the following: 

- **Service ID** - The id that is assigned to a certain service
- **Service Name** - The name of the service
- **Description** - A description that is related on what the referred service name is supposed to do. 
- **RestAPI Service IDs** : The RestAPI service ids that have to be included on the assigned microservice in order to perform the business logic that is described on the description field. 
- **RestAPI Service Names** : The corresponding service names of the "RestAPI Service IDs" column. 
- **Service Version** - The current version of the service that is available.

| 18.1.1.1   | Associate_serial_number_with_bucket_id | When a bucket_id is initialized throught the app at the same time we get the serial_number of the basecamp that is connected trought the same internet connection and it does not exist already under the same user. In that way we will be able to connect a basecamp serial number with a bucket_id from BucketDB | -6.1.3<br />- ?<br />18.1.1                                  | - Read Bucket  RestAPI<br />- **Reading out Teaching** <br /><br />- Create Mqtt_sensors_bucket RestAPI | 0.0             |
| 18.1.1.2   | Update_sensors_bucket_light_plans      | This service is performing all the required actions in order to relate the available light plans of the  BucketDB and the light plans from the Mqtt_sensorsDB. On the bucketDB there are all the light plans that are defined and which are capable to set a weekly light plan. This service is reading all the light plans from the BucketDB and defines the weekly schedule which is sent throught Mqtt Events to the basecmap. |                                                              | - Read Bucket  RestAPI<br />- Read Bucket Light Plan RestAPI<br />- Update Mqtt_sensors_bucket RestAPI<br />-**Time Plan** <br/> | 0.0             |
| 18.1.1.2   | Mqtt_sensors_bucket_init               | A request message is sent to backend in order to start the procedures to initialize the bucket records related to the sensors data from Mqtt. It is expected to correlate the basecamp's serial number with a bucket_id from the bucketDB. Since this is achieved  all the current and desired measurments of the basecamp are added in the same mqtt_sensors_bucket document. | -18.1.1.1<br />-?<br />-?<br />-?<br />-?<br />-18.1.1.2<br />-6.1.3<br />-18.1.1<br /> | -  Associate_serial_number_with_bucket_id<br />- **Connected**<br />- **Firmware Version**<br />- **Sensor Update**<br />- **Light**<br />- Update_Sensors_bucket_light_plans<br />- Read Bucket RestAPI<br />- Create Mqtt_sensors_bucket RestAPI<br /> | 0.0             |
| 18.1.1.3   | Update_mqtt_sensors_bucket_status      | This service is responsible to get the current states of a bucket_id from the BucketDB and the desired_stated from through the Mqtt Events and to merge this information inside the document that is related to the bucket_id or the serial_number of the product. | -?<br />-6.1.3<br />-?<br />-?<br />-?<br />-?<br />-?<br />-8.1.3<br />-6.1.3<br />-18.1.3<br /> | - **Reading out Teaching** <br >- Read Bucket  RestAPI<br />- **Connected**<br />- **Firmware Version**<br />- **Sensor Update**<br />- **Light**<br />- **Time Plan**<br />- Read Bucket Light Plan RestAPI<br />- Update Bucket RestAPI<br />- Update Mqtt_sensors_bucket RestAPI | 0.0             |
